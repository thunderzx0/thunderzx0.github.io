    <h2>Music</h2> 
    <p>One of my favourite hobbies is making and playing music.
    The instruments I currently play are:</p>
        <ul id="musicList">
        <li>Piano (Grade 8)</li>
        <li>Guitar (Grade 2)</li>
        </ul>
    <p>The music I make is a mixture between pop and classical. You can listen to it on Bandlab. <br>
        I also like to listen to music, some of my favourite artists are AJR and Cavetown.

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <P>Another one of my hobbies is playing with technology. <br>
        I'm currently learning how to code. (HTML, CSS and Python.) <br>
        (I also know Scratch, but that doesn't count...)
